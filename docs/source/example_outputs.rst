**Example of a Synthetically Generated Lung CT Image**

This figure displays a representative synthetically generated Lung CT image. This demonstrates the direct output quality of the model.

**Comparison of Generated vs. Real Images**

This figure provides a visual comparison between an image generated by the model and a corresponding real Lung CT image from the dataset. It allows for a direct qualitative assessment of the synthetic data's realism.

   Visual comparison showing a generated image next to a real image.

**Distribution of Image Characteristics**

This figure illustrates the distribution of certain image characteristics or metrics (e.g., pixel intensities, texture features) across both generated and real datasets. This helps in quantitatively assessing the similarity of the distributions.
