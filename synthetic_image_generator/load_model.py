"""
Module for loading pre-trained Conditional Normalizing Flow (CNF) model weights
from Google Drive.

This module provides a robust function, `load_model_from_drive`, to facilitate
the retrieval and initialization of a `CNF_UNet` model with pre-trained weights.
It handles downloading the weights file from a specified Google Drive URL,
loading it onto the correct device (CPU or CUDA), and setting the model to
evaluation mode.

It is designed to seamlessly integrate with a PyTorch project structure where
the `CNF_UNet` model and a `config` module (defining parameters like `IMAGE_SIZE`)
are available.

Functions
---------
load_model_from_drive(drive_url, output_path, image_size, device, image_channels, base_channels, time_embed_dim)
    Downloads model weights, loads them, and initializes the CNF_UNet model.

Notes
-----
- For environments where `CNF_UNet` or `config` imports might fail (e.g.,
  standalone script execution without the full project structure), dummy classes
  are provided as fallbacks to allow the script to run for demonstration purposes.
  These dummy classes will not provide functional model behavior.
- Logging is used to provide feedback during the download and loading processes.

    Downloads model weights from Google Drive, loads them, and initializes the CNF_UNet model.

    This function first checks if the specified `output_path` exists. If not,
    it attempts to download the weights file from the provided `drive_url` using `gdown`.
    Once the weights file is available, it loads the state dictionary,
    initializes a `CNF_UNet` model with the given architectural parameters,
    loads the weights into the model, and sets the model to evaluation mode.

    Parameters
    ----------
    drive_url : str
        The Google Drive URL (e.g., 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID')
        from which to download the zipped model weights.
    output_path : pathlib.Path
        The local file system path where the downloaded weights file will be saved.
        The parent directories will be created if they do not exist.
    image_size : tuple of int
        The (height, width) dimensions of the images that the model was trained on.
    device : torch.device
        The computational device (e.g., `torch.device("cuda")` or `torch.device("cpu")`)
        onto which the model and its weights should be loaded.
    image_channels : int
        The number of input channels for the model (e.g., 1 for grayscale images,
        3 for RGB images).
    base_channels : int
        The base number of feature channels used in the U-Net architecture of the model.
    time_embed_dim : int
        The dimensionality of the time embedding used within the model's architecture.

    Returns
    -------
    CNF_UNet
        An initialized `CNF_UNet` model instance with the pre-trained weights loaded
        and set to evaluation (`.eval()`) mode.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If the model weights cannot be downloaded from Google Drive,
        or if there's an error during loading the state dictionary,
        or during model initialization.
    FileNotFoundError
        If the `output_path` does not exist after skipping download (meaning
        the file was expected to be there but wasn't found).
